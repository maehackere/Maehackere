<a href="https://linkedin.com/in/hebah-hanieh"><img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/-LinkedIn-0072b1?&style=for-the-badge&logo=linkedin&logoColor=white" /></a>

Motivated and detail-oriented Cybersecurity and IT student with practical experience in threat analysis, risk assessment, and administrative support. Skilled in investigating cyber threats, producing detailed reports, and applying technical expertise in Python programming and ethical hacking. Committed to securing and optimizing digital environments through strong analytical thinking and technical problem-solving. Seeking an entry-level role or internship in Cybersecurity or IT to contribute skills, grow professionally, and support organisational security goals.


## Objective

I'm on a mission to break into cybersecurity — ethically, of course — with a goal of joining an organistion as an intern - or something more. I love solving puzzles, scripting solutions, and demystifying tech for others. Let’s just say: if it has logs, I’ll read them.

- I’m currently working on:] CV upgrades, and my coffee addiction.
- I’m looking to collaborate on: Capture The Flag (CTF) challenges, cyber awareness campaigns, or building a cyber side project that actually ships.
- I’m looking for help with: breaking into the cybersecurity industry (figuratively, of course — I don't do illegal things unless it's in a safe virtual lab).
