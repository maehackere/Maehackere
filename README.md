# Hello, I'm [Your Name]
<a href="https://linkedin.com/in/yourprofile"><img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/-LinkedIn-0072b1?&style=for-the-badge&logo=linkedin&logoColor=white" /></a>

I am a Cybersecurity student at the University of Technology Sydney with a Distinction WAM, practical hands-on experience in incident response simulations, and a strong interest in defensive security. I'm seeking an entry-level opportunity or internship in Cybersecurity to contribute to organisational security goals and grow within a SOC environment.

## Objective

My goal is to join a Security Operations Center (SOC) as a Tier 1 Analyst where I can leverage my skills in threat detection, risk assessment, scripting, and reporting to improve incident response and digital security.
