# Hello, I'm Hebah
<a href="https://linkedin.com/in/hebah-hanieh"><img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/-LinkedIn-0072b1?&style=for-the-badge&logo=linkedin&logoColor=white" /></a>

Motivated Cybersecurity and IT student eager to secure an internship to gain real-world experience and sharpen skills. Passionate about threat analysis, ethical hacking, and Python programming. Always up for a challenge—and having fun competing in CTF games.


## Objective

I'm on a mission to break into cybersecurity — ethically, of course — with a goal of joining an organistion as an intern - or something more. I love solving puzzles, scripting solutions, and demystifying tech for others. Let’s just say: if it has logs, I’ll read them.

- I’m currently working on:] CV upgrades, and my coffee addiction.
- I’m looking to collaborate on: Capture The Flag (CTF) challenges, cyber awareness campaigns, or building a cyber side project that actually ships.
- I’m looking for help with: breaking into the cybersecurity industry (figuratively, of course — I don't do illegal things unless it's in a safe virtual lab).
